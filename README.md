# MIT Joint Program SPGC - Student Luncheon Slides

**July 16, 2015**

These are slides I made for a luncheon presentation for the students of the [MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](http://globalchange.mit.edu/), using an IPython Notebook. Additionally, I showed a version of my [mode sunburst visualization](http://bl.ocks.org/darothen/269ed42d1a1f7cec66be) and some results from a recent simulation obtained with a [specialized analysis package](https://github.mit.edu/darothen/marc_aie) I've been developing.

To view the slides as a presentation, go [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/format/slides/github/darothen/jp_lunch_summer_2015/blob/master/jp_slides.ipynb#/)!

Links to tools mentioned should be available directly in the presentation.
